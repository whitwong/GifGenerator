# GifGenerator
Created a Gif Generator with a Superhero theme. This application allows users to input new characters and creates new character buttons. When a user selects a button, an AJAX request is made to the Giphy API and returns 10 gifs. These 10 gifs are appended to the page. The still and animated states of the gifs can be toggled on and off by clicking on the gif.

**Technology used:** API, AJAX, Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Below is a screenshot of the application:
